    "body": "AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSEVersion 1, March 2002\n\nCopyright Â© 2002 Affero Inc.510 Third Street - Suite 225, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA\n\nThis license is a modified version of the GNU General Public License copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free\nSoftware Foundation, Inc. made with their permission. Section 2(d) has been added to cover use of\nsoftware over a computer network.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is\nnot allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By\ncontrast, the Affero General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This Public License applies to\nmost of Affero's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other\nAffero software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. This General Public License is\ndesigned to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can\nchange the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these\nthings.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to\nask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\nyou distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the\nrecipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which\ngives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there\nis no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\nby others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that\nredistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\neveryone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright\nholder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Affero General Public License. The\n\"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means\neither the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work\ncontaining the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\ntranslated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in\nany medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that\nrefer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\nProgram a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based\non the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section\n1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code\nor executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of\nthe following:\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided\nunder this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the\nProgram is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,\nparties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their\nlicenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else\ngrants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These\nactions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or\ndistributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of\nthis License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient\nautomatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the\nProgram subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on\nthe recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\ncompliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other\nreason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,\nagreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you\nfrom the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously\nyour obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence\nyou may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\nroyalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or\nindirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be\nto refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by\npatents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program\nunder this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In\nsuch case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this\nLicense.\n\n9. Affero Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of the Affero General Public License from\ntime to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution\nconditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is\ncopyrighted by Affero, Inc., write to us; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision\nwill be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\nsoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE\nEXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER\nEXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY\nAND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nPROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY\nSERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\nOR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE\nLIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY\nHAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES."
