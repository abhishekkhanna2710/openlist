    "body": "GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSEVersion 3, 19 November 2007\n\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n<https://fsf.org/>\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure\ncooperation with the community in the case of network server software.\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are\ndesigned to take away your freedom to share and change the\nworks. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended\nto guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a\nprogram--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\nit in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nDevelopers that use our General Public Licenses protect\nyour rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the\nsoftware, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nA secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements\nmade in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread\nuse, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many\ndevelopers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the\nresulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network\nservers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public\nLicense permits making a modified version and letting the public access\nit on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.\n\nThe GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically\nto ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes\navailable to the community. It requires the operator of a\nnetwork server to provide the source code of the modified version\nrunning there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use\nof a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives\nthe public access to the source code of the modified version.\n\nAn older license, called the Affero General Public License and published\nby Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different\nlicense, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new\nversion of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying,\ndistribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n1. Source Code.The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred\nform of the work for making modifications to it.\n\"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\nnotice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the\ncode; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and\ngive all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms\nof section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.You may convey a covered work in object code form\nunder the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you\nalso convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source\nunder the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n7. Additional Terms.\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program\nshall be treated as though they were included in this License, to\nthe extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional\npermissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used\nseparately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains\ngoverned by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n8. Termination.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n11. Patents.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be\nof the greatest possible use to the public, the best\nway to achieve this is to make it free software which\neveryone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line to give the program's name and\na brief idea of what it does.>Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation, either\nversion 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty\nof MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nSee the GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License along with this program. If not, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf your software can interact with users remotely through a\ncomputer network, you should also make sure that it provides a\nway for users to get its source. For example, if your program is\na web application, its interface could display a \"Source\" link\nthat leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways\nyou could offer source, and different solutions will be better for\ndifferent programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)\nor school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for\nthe program, if necessary.
