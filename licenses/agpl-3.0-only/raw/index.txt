GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSEVersion 3, 19 November 2007

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are
designed to take away your freedom to share and change the
works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended
to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a
program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of
it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect
your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the
software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements
made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread
use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many
developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the
resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network
servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public
License permits making a modified version and letting the public access
it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically
to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes
available to the community. It requires the operator of a
network server to provide the source code of the modified version
running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use
of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives
the public access to the source code of the modified version.

An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published
by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different
license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new
version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.

The precise terms and conditions for copying,
distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

1. Source Code.The "source code" for a work means the preferred
form of the work for making modifications to it.
"Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

2. Basic Permissions.All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.You may convey a covered work in object code form
under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you
also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source
under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

7. Additional Terms."Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program
shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to
the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional
permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used
separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains
governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

8. Termination.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

11. Patents.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

16. Limitation of Liability.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be
of the greatest possible use to the public, the best
way to achieve this is to make it free software which
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the program's name and
a brief idea of what it does.>Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either
version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty
of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
See the GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General
Public License along with this program. If not, see
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If your software can interact with users remotely through a
computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a
way for users to get its source. For example, if your program is
a web application, its interface could display a "Source" link
that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways
you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for
different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)
or school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for
the program, if necessary. For more information on this,
and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see
