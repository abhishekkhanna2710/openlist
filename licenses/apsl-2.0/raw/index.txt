EXHIBIT A.

1. General; Definitions. This License applies to any program or other work which Apple Inc.
("Apple") makes publicly available and which contains a notice placed by Apple
identifying such program or work as "Original Code" and stating that it is subject
to the terms of this Apple Public Source License version 2.0 ("License"). As used in
this License:

2. Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License and download
the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of
Apple's Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the
following:

3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this
License, You hereby grant to any person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under
this License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, under Your
Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or
controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute and
Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Apple's licenses
under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.

4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed
by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such
instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
Code or any portion thereof.

5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights,
express or implied, are granted by Apple herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require
additional patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.

6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted
herein ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple
or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional
Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple and
every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or
such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.

7. Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time
to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has
been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under
the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of
any subsequent version of this License published by Apple. No one other than Apple has the
right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested,
or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or
loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and
agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk.
THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF
ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "APPLE"
FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES
AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE AND
EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED
CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE
OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE
COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN
APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge
that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft
navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure
of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental
damage.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY
CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY
PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY
REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's
total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under
this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names
"Apple", "Mac", "Mac OS", "QuickTime", "QuickTime
Streaming Server" or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging
to Apple (collectively "Apple Marks") or to any trademark, service mark, logo or
trade name belonging to any Contributor. You agree not to use any Apple Marks in or as part of
the name of products derived from the Original Code or to endorse or promote products derived
from the Original Code other than as expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all
times with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at
http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.

11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all
rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor. Apple retains
all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on
behalf of Apple ("Apple Modifications"), and such Apple Modifications will not be
automatically subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license
such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in
this License or may choose not to license them at all.

12. Termination.
