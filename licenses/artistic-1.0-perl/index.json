(You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright\nHolder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\n\n\"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees\ninvolved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the\nsame conditions they received it.\n\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this\nPackage without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices\nand associated disclaimers.\n\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain\nor from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the\nStandard Version.\n\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a\nprominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided\nthat you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that\nyou do at least ONE of the following:\n\n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any\nfee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.\nHowever, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial)\nprograms as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do\nnot advertise this Package as a product of your own. You may embed this Package's\ninterpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere form\nof aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so\nembedded.\n\n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of\nthis Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to\nwhoever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.\nIf such scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called\n\"undump\" or \"unexec\" methods of producing a binary executable image, then\ndistribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor\nshall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent\nsuch an executable image as a Standard Version of this Package.\n\n7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) supplied by you and linked\ninto this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by\nthis Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as\nin Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would\ncause it to fail the regression tests for the language.\n\n8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the\nuse of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this\nPackage's interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use\nshall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.\n\n9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this\nsoftware without specific prior written permission.\n\n10.
