  BitTorrent Open Source LicenseVersion 1.0


  This BitTorrent Open Source License (the "License") applies to the BitTorrent
  client and

  related software products as well as any updates or maintenance releases of
  that software

  ("BitTorrent Products") that are distributed by BitTorrent, Inc. ("Licensor").
  Any

  BitTorrent Product licensed pursuant to this License is a Licensed Product.
  Licensed Product, in its

  entirety, is protected by U.S. copyright law. This License identifies the
  terms under which you may

  use, copy, distribute or modify Licensed Product.


  Preamble


  This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature and scope
  of this License. However,

  this Preamble is not a part of this license. The legal effect of this License
  is dependent only upon

  the terms of the License and not this Preamble.


  This License complies with the Open Source Definition and is derived from the
  Jabber Open Source License

  1.0 (the "JOSL"), which has been approved by Open Source Initiative. Sections
  4(c) and

  4(f)(iii) from the JOSL have been dropped.


  This License provides that:


  You may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in which
  case the provisions of this

  License will apply to your Derivative Works just as they do to the original
  Licensed Product.


  Alternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other
  OSI-approved Open Source license,

  or under a proprietary license of your choice. If you use any license other
  than this License,

  however, you must continue to fulfill the requirements of this License
  (including the provisions

  relating to publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative
  Works that consist of

  the Licensed Product, including the files containing Modifications.


  New versions of this License may be published from time to time. You may
  choose to continue to use the

  license terms in this version of the License or those from the new version.
  However, only the Licensor

  has the right to change the License terms as they apply to the Licensed
  Product.


  This License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are
  defined when they are first

  used, and the definitions are repeated for your convenience in a Glossary at
  the end of the

  License.


  License Terms


  1. You may use, sell or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as a
  component of an aggregate

  software distribution containing programs from several different sources. No
  royalty or other

  fee is required.


  2. Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed Product, including
  Modifications made by

  previous Contributors, are available for your use. (The terms "Licensed
  Product,"

  "Modifications," "Contributors" and "Source Code" are defined in

  the License.)


  3. You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product, and you can
  create Derivative

  Works from it. (The term "Derivative Works" is defined in the License.)


  4. By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this License, you
  agree that any

  Modifications you make to the Licensed Product and then distribute are
  governed by the

  provisions of this License. In particular, you must make the Source Code of
  your Modifications

  available to others.


  5. You may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the Licensor is not
  providing you any

  warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any liability in the event
  that the

  Licensed Product doesn't work properly or causes you any injury or damages.


  6. If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you may charge
  fees for warranty or

  support, or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations to your
  customers. You cannot

  charge for the Source Code.


  7. If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to the
  Licensed Product, or if you

  breach any terms of the License, your rights to the Licensed Product under
  this License

  automatically terminate.


  1. Grant of License From Licensor. Licensor hereby grants you a world-wide,
  royalty-free,

  non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to
  do the

  following:


  2. Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor. "Modifications" means
  any additions

  to or deletions from the substance or structure of (i) a file containing
  Licensed Product, or

  (ii) any new file that contains any part of Licensed Product. Hereinafter in
  this License, the

  term "Licensed Product" shall include all previous Modifications that you
  receive

  from any Contributor. By application of the provisions in Section 4(a) below,
  each person or

  entity who created or contributed to the creation of, and distributed, a
  Modification (a

  "Contributor") hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
  license,

  subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following:


  3. Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to
  grant any rights to

  trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual
  property of Licensor

  or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is
  granted separate

  from the Licensed Product, for code that you delete from the Licensed Product,
  or for

  combinations of the Licensed Product with other software or hardware. No right
  is granted to

  the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included
  in the Licensed

  Product. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor
  from licensing

  under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would
  have a right to

  license.


  4. Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.


  5. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for
  you to comply with any

  of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed
  Product due to

  statute, judicial order, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the
  terms of this

  License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the statute or regulation
  that prohibits you

  from adhering to the License, and (iii) describe the limitations and the code
  they affect.

  Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 4(d),
  and must be

  included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent
  prohibited by statute

  or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient
  of ordinary

  skill at computer programming to be able to understand it.


  6. Application of This License. This License applies to code to which Licensor
  or Contributor has

  attached the Notice in Exhibit A, which is incorporated herein by this
  reference.


  7. Versions of This License.


  8. Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON
  AN AS IS BASIS,

  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION,

  WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR
  A PARTICULAR

  PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
  OF THE LICENSED

  PRODUCT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
  YOU (AND NOT THE

  LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
  REPAIR OR

  CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
  LICENSE. NO USE

  OF LICENSED PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.


  9. Termination.


  10. Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
  WHETHER TORT

  (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY
  CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY

  DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
  LIABLE TO ANY

  PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
  CHARACTER

  INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
  COMPUTER FAILURE

  OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF
  SUCH PARTY SHALL

  HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
  LIABILITY SHALL NOT

  APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURYRESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS
  NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH

  LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
  INCIDENTAL

  OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO
  YOU.


  11. Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each
  party is responsible for

  claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of
  rights under

  this License. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute
  such

  responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended orshall be
  deemed to constitute any admission of liability.


  12. U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Product is a commercial item, as
  that term is defined in

  48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software and
  commercial

  computer software documentation, as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
  (Sept. 1995).

  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
  (June 1995),

  all U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed Product with only those rights
  set forth herein.


  13. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
  the subject matter

  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
  provision shall be

  reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License
  shall be governed

  by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
  provides otherwise),

  excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that any
  litigation relating to

  this license shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
  Northern District

  of California or the Superior Court of the County of Santa Clara, California
  (as appropriate),

  with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party
  responsible for costs

  including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and
  expenses. The

  application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
  International Sale of Goods is

  expressly excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury
  trial in any litigation

  concerning Licensed Product or this License. Any law or regulation that
  provides that the language

  of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
  License.


  14. Definition of You in This License. You throughout this License, whether in
  upper or lower case,

  with all of the

  terms of, this License or a future version of this License issued under

  entities, you includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under
  common control

  with you. For purposes of this definition, control means (i) the power, direct
  or indirect,

  to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
  otherwise, or
