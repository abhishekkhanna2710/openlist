    "body": "BitTorrent Open Source LicenseVersion 1.1\n\nThis BitTorrent Open Source License (the \"License\") applies to the BitTorrent client and\nrelated software products as well as any updates or maintenance releases of that software\n(\"BitTorrent Products\") that are distributed by BitTorrent, Inc. (\"Licensor\"). Any\nBitTorrent Product licensed pursuant to this License is a Licensed Product. Licensed Product, in its\nentirety, is protected by U.S. copyright law. This License identifies the terms under which you may\nuse, copy, distribute or modify Licensed Product.\n\nPreamble\n\nThis Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature and scope of this License. However,\nthis Preamble is not a part of this license. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon\nthe terms of the License and not this Preamble.\n\nThis License complies with the Open Source Definition and is derived from the Jabber Open Source License\n1.0 (the \"JOSL\"), which has been approved by Open Source Initiative. Sections 4(c) and\n4(f)(iii) from the JOSL have been deleted.\n\nThis License provides that:\n\nYou may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in which case the provisions of this\nLicense will apply to your Derivative Works just as they do to the original Licensed Product.\n\nAlternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other OSI-approved Open Source license,\nor under a proprietary license of your choice. If you use any license other than this License,\nhowever, you must continue to fulfill the requirements of this License (including the provisions\nrelating to publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative Works that consist of\nthe Licensed Product, including the files containingModifications.\n\nNew versions of this License may be published from time to time in connection with new versions of a\nLicensed Product or otherwise. You may choose to continue to use the license terms in this version of\nthe License for the Licensed Product that was originally licensed hereunder, however, the new versions\nof this License will at all times apply to new versions of the Licensed Product released by Licensor\nafter the release of the new version of this License. Only the Licensor has the right to change the\nLicense terms as they apply to the Licensed Product.\n\nThis License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are defined when they are first\nused, and the definitions are repeated for your convenience in a Glossary at the end of the\nLicense.\n\nLicense Terms\n\n1. You may use or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as a component of an aggregate software\ndistribution containing programs from several different sources. No royalty or other fee is\nrequired.\n\n2. Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed Product, including Modifications made by\nprevious Contributors, are available for your use. (The terms \"Licensed Product,\"\n\"Modifications,\" \"Contributors\" and \"Source Code\" are defined in\nthe License.)\n\n3. You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product, and you can create Derivative\nWorks from it. (The term \"Derivative Works\" is defined in the License.)\n\n4. By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this License, you agree that any\nModifications you make to the Licensed Product and then distribute are governed by the\nprovisions of this License. In particular, you must make the Source Code of your Modifications\navailable to others free of charge and without a royalty.\n\n5. You may sell, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for executable versions of a\nLicensed Product, without paying a royalty or other fee to the Licensor or any Contributor,\nprovided that such executable versions contain your or another Contributor's material\nModifications. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent your executable version of a Licensed\nProduct does not contain your or another Contributor's material Modifications, you may\nnot sell, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for such executable.\n\n6. If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you may charge fees for warranty or\nsupport, or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations to your customers. You cannot\ncharge for, sell, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for the Source Code.\n\n7. If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to the Licensed Product, or if you\nbreach any terms of the License, your rights to the Licensed Product under this License\nautomatically terminate.\n\n1. Grant of License From Licensor. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor\nhereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party\nintellectual property claims, to do the following:\n\n2. Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor. \"Modifications\" means any additions\nto or deletions from the substance or structure of (i) a file containing a Licensed Product,\nor (ii) any new file that contains any part of a Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this\nLicense, the term \"Licensed Product\" shall include all previous Modifications that\nyou receive from any Contributor. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, By\napplication of the provisions in Section 4(a) below, each person or entity who created or\ncontributed to the creation of, and distributed, a Modification (a \"Contributor\")\nhereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party\nintellectual property claims, to do the following:\n\n3. Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to\ntrademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor\nor any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted separate\nfrom the Licensed Product, for code that you delete from the Licensed Product, or for\ncombinations of the Licensed Product with other software or hardware. No right is granted to\nthe trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Licensed\nProduct. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing\nunder different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to\nlicense. As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that\nyou will not, without the prior written consent of Licensor, use any trademarks, copyrights,\npatents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor\nexcept as expressly stated herein. For the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the\nforegoing, you hereby agree that you will not use or display any trademark of Licensor or any\nContributor in any domain name, directory filepath, advertisement, link or other reference to\nyou in any manner or in any media.\n\n4. Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.\n\n5. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for you to comply with any\nof the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the terms of this\nLicense to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you\nfrom adhering to the License, and (iii) describe the limitations and the code they affect.\nSuch description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 4(d), and must be\nincluded with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary\nskill at computer programming to be able to understand it.\n\n6.

You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such\nresponsibility on an equitable basis.
