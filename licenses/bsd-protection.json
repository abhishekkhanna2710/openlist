    "body": "BSD Protection LicenseFebruary 2002\n\nPreamble--------\n\nThe Berkeley Software Distribution (\"BSD\") license has proven very effective over the years at\nallowing for a wide spread of work throughout both commercial and non-commercial products. For\nprogrammers whose primary intention is to improve the general quality of available software, it is\narguable that there is no better license than the BSD license, as it permits improvements to be used\nwherever they will help, without idealogical or metallic constraint.\n\nThis is of particular value to those who produce reference implementations of proposed standards: The\ncase of TCP/IP clearly illustrates that freely and universally available implementations leads the\nrapid acceptance of standards -- often even being used instead of a de jure standard (eg, OSI network\nmodels).\n\nWith the rapid proliferation of software licensed under the GNU General Public License, however, the\ncontinued success of this role is called into question. Given that the inclusion of a few lines of\n\"GPL-tainted\" work into a larger body of work will result in restricted distribution -- and\ngiven that further work will likely build upon the \"tainted\" portions, making them difficult\nto remove at a future date -- there are inevitable circumstances where authors would, in order to\nprotect their goal of providing for the widespread usage of their work, wish to guard against such\n\"GPL-taint\".\n\nIn addition, one can imagine that companies which operate by producing and selling (possibly\nclosed-source) code would wish to protect themselves against the rise of a GPL-licensed competitor.\nWhile under existing licenses this would mean not releasing their code under any form of open license,\nif a license existed under which they could incorporate any improvements back into their own\n(commercial) products then they might be far more willing to provide for non-closed distribution.\n\nFor the above reasons, we put forth this \"BSD Protection License\": A license designed to retain\nthe freedom granted by the BSD license to use licensed works in a wide variety of settings, both\nnon-commercial and commercial, while protecting the work from having future contributors restrict that\nfreedom.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification follow.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBSD PROTECTION LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\nEXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING,\nBUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR\nBUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT\nLIABILITY, OR TORT, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\na) \"Program\", below, refers to any program or work distributed under the terms of this\nlicense.\n\nb) A \"work based on the Program\", below, refers to either the Program or any\nderivative work under copyright law.\n\nc) \"Modification\", below, refers to the act of creating derivative works.\n\nd) \"You\", below, refers to each licensee.\n\n1. Scope.This license governs the copying, distribution, and modification of the Program. Other\nactivities are outside the scope of this license; The act of running the Program is\nnot restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program.\n\n2. Verbatim copies.You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program as you receive it, in any\nmedium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\nand to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a\ncopy of this License along with the Program.\n\n3. Modification and redistribution under closed license.You may modify your copy or copies of the Program, and distribute the resulting derivative\nworks, provided that you meet the following conditions:\n\na) The copyright notice and disclaimer on the Program must be reproduced and included in the\nsource code, documentation, and/or other materials provided in a manner in which such\nnotices are normally distributed.\n\nb) The derivative work must be clearly identified as such, in order that it may not be confused\nwith the original work.\n\nc) The license under which the derivative work is distributed must expressly prohibit the\ndistribution of further derivative works.\n\n4. Modification and redistribution under open license.You may modify your copy or copies of the Program, and distribute the resulting derivative\nworks, provided that you meet the following conditions:\n\na) The copyright notice and disclaimer on the Program must be reproduced and included in the\nsource code, documentation, and/or other materials provided in a manner in which such\nnotices are normally distributed.\n\nb) You must clearly indicate the nature and date of any changes made to the Program. The full\ndetails need not necessarily be included in the individual modified files, provided that\neach modified file is clearly marked as such and instructions are included on where the\nfull details of the modifications may be found.\n\nc) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or\nis derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to\nall third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n5. Implied acceptance.You may not copy or distribute the Program or any derivative works except as expressly\nprovided under this license. Consequently, any such action will be taken as implied\nacceptance of the terms of this license.\n\n6. NO WARRANTY.",
