  THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE

  COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ("CCPL" OR "LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
  COPYRIGHT

  AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORISED
  UNDER

  THIS LICENCE AND/OR APPLICABLE LAW IS PROHIBITED.


  BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE

  BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
  CONTAINED

  HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.


  1. Definitions


  a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or

  encyclopaedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
  with a

  number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in

  themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a

  Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below)
  for the

  purposes of this Licence.


  b. "Derivative Work" means a work that reproduces a substantial part of the
  Work,

  or of the Work and other pre-existing works protected by copyright, or that is
  an

  adaptation of a Work that is a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work.

  Derivative Works include a translation, musical arrangement, dramatisation,

  motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
  condensation,

  or any other form in which a work may be adapted, except that a

  work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative
  Work for

  the purpose of this Licence. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a

  musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in
  timed-relation

  with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for

  the purpose of this Licence.


  c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
  terms of

  this Licence.


  d. "Moral rights law" means laws under which an individual who creates a work

  protected by copyright has rights of integrity of authorship of the work,
  rights of

  attribution of authorship of the work, rights not to have authorship of the
  work

  falsely attributed, or rights of a similar or analogous nature in the work
  anywhere

  in the world.


  e. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.


  f. "Work" means the work or other subject-matter protected by copyright that
  is

  offered under the terms of this Licence, which may include (without
  limitation) a

  literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, a sound recording or
  cinematograph

  film, a published edition of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work or
  a

  television or sound broadcast.


  g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this Licence
  who has

  not previously violated the terms of this Licence with respect to the Work, or
  who

  has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
  this

  Licence despite a previous violation.


  h. "Licence Elements" means the following high-level licence attributes as
  selected

  by Licensor and indicated in the title of this Licence: Attribution,
  NonCommercial,

  NoDerivatives, ShareAlike.


  2. Fair Dealing and Other Rights. Nothing in this Licence excludes or
  modifies, or is intended

  to exclude or modify, (including by reducing, limiting, or restricting) the
  rights of You or others to

  use the Work arising from fair dealings or other limitations on the rights of
  the copyright owner

  or the Original Author under copyright law, moral rights law or other
  applicable laws.


  3. Licence Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence,
  Licensor hereby grants

  You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of
  the applicable

  copyright) licence to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:


  4. Restrictions. The licence granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
  subject to and limited

  by the following restrictions:


  5. Disclaimer.


  6. Limitation on Liability.


  7. Termination.


  8. Miscellaneous.
