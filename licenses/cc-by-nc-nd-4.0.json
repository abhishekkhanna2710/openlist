The following considerations are for\ninformational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\nConsiderations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the\n         public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights.\n         Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the\n         license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n         applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly\n         mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material\n         used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors\n\nConsiderations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public\n         permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s\n         permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or\n         limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only\n         permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n         the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have\n         copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that\n         all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n         respect those requests where reasonable.for the public\n\nCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License\n\nBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and\nconditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public\nLicense (\"Public License\").
