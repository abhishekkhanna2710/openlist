DISTRIBUTION OF THIS\nDOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION\nON AN \"AS-IS\" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT\nOR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE\nUSE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.\n\nFor more information, please see <http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>\n\nStatement of Purpose\n\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related\nRights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\")\nof an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\n\nCertain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a\ncommons of creative, cultural and scientific works (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably\nand without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse\nand redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without\nlimitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a\nfree culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration\nor compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that\nhe or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to\nthe Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and\nRelated Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and\nrelated or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and\nRelated Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law,\nAffirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons,\nand surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and\ncauses of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims\nand causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any\ncurrent or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\nincluding without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the\n\"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at\nlarge and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such\nWaiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other\nlegal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as\ncontemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid\nor ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent\npermitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to\nthe extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\nroyalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and\nunconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i)\nin all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any\nnumber of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall\nbe deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of\nthe License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\npartial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and\nin such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her\nremaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and\ncauses of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express\nStatement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers."}
