  PREAMBLE


  The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users the
  right to modify and

  redistribute the software governed by this license within the framework of an
  "open source"

  distribution model.


  The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain obligations for
  users so as to ensure that

  this status is retained for subsequent redistribution operations.


  As a counterpart to the access to the source code and rights to copy, modify
  and redistribute granted by

  the license, users are provided only with a limited warranty and the
  software's author, the

  holder of the economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited
  liability.


  In this respect, it is brought to the user's attention that the risks
  associated with loading,

  using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user
  given its nature of Free

  Software, that may mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also
  therefore means that it is

  reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer
  knowledge. Users are

  therefore encouraged to load and test the Software's suitability as regards
  their requirements in

  conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured
  and, more generally, to

  use and operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may be
  freely reproduced and

  published, provided it is not altered, and that no Articles are either added
  or removed herefrom.


  This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the
  economic rights decides to

  submit the operation thereof to its provisions.
