  CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal


  Preamble


  CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among hardware
  designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the freedom to use,
  study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs and products based on
  those designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open Hardware Licence comes in three
  variants: CERN-OHL-P (permissive); and two reciprocal licences: CERN-OHL-W
  (weakly reciprocal) and this licence, CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal).


  The CERN-OHL-S is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in
  unmodified form only.


  Use of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any Licensor or
  their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in their development.
