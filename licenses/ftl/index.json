The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and\nmakefiles, at the very least.\n\nThis license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all\nencourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a\nconsequence, its main points are that:\n\nWe specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in\ncommercial products. We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability\nrelated to The FreeType Project.\n\nFinally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this\nlicense. We thus encourage you to use the following text:\n\n\"\"\" Portions of this software are copyright Â© <year> The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org).
