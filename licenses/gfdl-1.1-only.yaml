  ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents To use this License in a
  document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and
  put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:
  Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or
  modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License,
  Version 1.1 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover
  Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. A copy of the
  license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".
  If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections" instead
  of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover Texts, write
  "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for
  Back-Cover Texts. If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
  code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
  free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their
  use in free software.
