  ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

  To use this License in a document you have written, include
  a copy of the License in the document and put the following
  copyright and license notices just after the title page:

  Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,
  distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
  Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published
  by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections,
  no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is
  included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".

  If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and
  Back-Cover Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

  with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
  Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

  If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts,
  or some other combination of the three, merge
  those two alternatives to suit the situation.

  If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
  code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel
  under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU
  General Public License, to permit their use in free software.
