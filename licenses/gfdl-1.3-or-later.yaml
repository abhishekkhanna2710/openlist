  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
  document, but changing it is not allowed.


  ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents To use this License in a
  document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and
  put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:
  Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or
  modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License,
  Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A
  copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free
  Documentation License". If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and
  Back-Cover Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this: with the
  Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being
  LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. If you have Invariant Sections
  without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two
  alternatives to suit the situation. If your document contains nontrivial
  examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel
  under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
  License, to permit their use in free software.
