By\ncontrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to\nthe Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using\nit. You can use it for your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public\nLicense is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free\nsoftware, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software\nor use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to\nask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\nyou distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the\nrecipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. And you must tell them their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which\ngives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that\nthere is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed\non, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems\nintroduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the\ncopyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\nThe \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on\nthe Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of\nit, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it,\nin any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that\nrefer to this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\nrecipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You\nmay charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute\nsuch modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the\nfollowing:\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in\nobject code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you\nalso do one of the following:\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly\nprovided under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,\ndistribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to\nuse the Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to\nuse copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses terminated\nso long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the Program) you indicate\nyour acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient\nautomatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the\nProgram subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on\nthe recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\n7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public\nLicense from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution\nconditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving\nthe free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse\nof software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\nBECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE\nEXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE\nCOST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\nOR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE\nLIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY\nHAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best\nway to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\nterms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each\nsource file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive\nmode:\n\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY;\nfor details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under\ncertain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the\nGeneral Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show\nw' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your\nprogram.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a\n\"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (a program to\ndirect compilers to make passes at assemblers) written by James Hacker.\n\n<signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!","type":"source-available"}
