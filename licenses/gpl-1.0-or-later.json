By contrast, our General\nPublic License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share\nand change free software--to make sure the software is free for\nall its users. The General Public License applies to the Free\nSoftware Foundation's software and to any other program whose\nauthors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to\nmake sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies\nof free software, that you receive source code or can get it if\nyou want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights\nthat you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or\ncan get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the\nsoftware, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make\ncertain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for\nthis free software. If the software is modified by someone else\nand passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they\nhave is not the original, so that any problems introduced by\nothers will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying,\ndistribution and modification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nFOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may\nbe distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\nThe \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and\na \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\nwork containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim\nor with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence\nof any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a\ncopy of this General Public License along with the Program. You\nmay charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms\nof Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion\nor derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code\nor executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and\n2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the\nProgram except as expressly provided under this General Public\nLicense. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,\ndistribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically\nterminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However,\nparties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from\nyou under this General Public License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any\nwork based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of\nthis license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject\nto these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\n7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the General Public License from time to time. Such\nnew versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\nauthor to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\nFree Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\ntwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\nsoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\nBECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT\nWHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER\nPARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\nTHE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU\nASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\nDAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\nDAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\n(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\nINACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\nTHE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\nOR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be\nof the greatest possible use to humanity, the best\nway to achieve this is to make it free software which\neveryone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author\nGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details\ntype `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to\nredistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\nappropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands\nyou use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they\ncould even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)\nor your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for\nthe program, if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in\nthe program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers\nto make passes at assemblers) written by James Hacker.\n\n<signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!",
