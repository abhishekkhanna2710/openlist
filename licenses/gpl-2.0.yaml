body: "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSEVersion 2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom\nto share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\nintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\nmake sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public\nLicense applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software\nand to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other\nFree Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\nOur General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have\nthe freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you\nhave. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the\nsoftware, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make\ncertain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for\nthis free software. If the software is modified by someone else\nand passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they\nhave is not the original, so that any problems introduced by\nothers will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nWe wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program\nwill individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\nproprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent\nmust be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying,\ndistribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation\nin the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\nand disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\nthis License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\nrecipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section\n1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program\nis void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License. However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have\nnot signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to\nmodify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These\nactions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.\nTherefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any\nwork based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this\nLicense to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,\ndistributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\non the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\nresponsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement\nor otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\nthey do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you\ncannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations\nunder this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example,\nif a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of\nthe Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\nthrough you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,\nthe original copyright holder who places the Program under this\nLicense may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\nexcluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\nin or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License\nincorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the General Public License from time to time. Such\nnew versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\nauthor to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\nFree Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\ntwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\nsoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT\nWHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER\nPARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\nTHE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU\nASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\nDAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\nDAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\n(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\nINACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\nTHE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\nOR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be\nof the greatest possible use to the public, the best\nway to achieve this is to make it free software which\neveryone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\none line to give the program's name andidea of what it does.Copyright (C)name of author\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\nas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version\n2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be\nuseful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied\nwarranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,\n        Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to\ncontact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\nGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details\ntype `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to\nredistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\nappropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands\nyou use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they\ncould even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)\nor your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for\nthe program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\nsignature of Ty Coon,\n\t1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License."
