By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your\nfreedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all\nits users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our\nsoftware; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your\nprograms, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are\ndesigned to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the\nsoftware or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to\nsurrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to\nthe recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can\nget the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software,\nand (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty\nfor this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified\nversions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of\nprevious versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside\nthem, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in\nthe area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.\nTherefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If\nsuch problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those\ndomains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to\nrestrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\nto avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively\nproprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program\nnon-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal\neffect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or\nassumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n1. Source Code.The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program,\nand are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly\naffirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from\nrunning a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use\nor other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any\napplicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty\nadopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention\nof such measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any\nmedium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and\nany non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact\nall notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this\nLicense along with the Program.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the\nProgram, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you\nalso meet all of these conditions:\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5,\nprovided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the\nterms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n7. Additional Terms.“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License\nby making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that\nare applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in\nthis License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional\npermissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under\nthose permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without\nregard to the additional permissions.\n\n8. Termination.You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this\nLicense. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses\ngranted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the\nProgram. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of\nusing peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require\nacceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to\npropagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not\naccept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you\nindicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from\nthe original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this\nLicense. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this\nLicense.\n\n11. Patents.A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License\nof the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is\ncalled the contributor's “contributor version”.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\ncontradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions\nof this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously\nyour obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that\nobligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be\nto refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine\nany covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public\nLicense into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of\nthis License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the\nspecial requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning\ninteraction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General\nPublic License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the\npresent version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT\nWHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE\nTHE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\nTHE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT\nHOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE,\nBE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\n(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES\nSUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY\nOTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best\nway to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\nterms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each\nsource file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an\ninteractive mode:\n\n<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show\nc' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the\nGeneral Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI\ninterface, you would use an “about box”.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a\n“copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and\nhow to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If\n         your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary\n         applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public\n         License instead of this License.
