GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSEVersion 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is
not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all
its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our
software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your
programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to
surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to
the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software,
and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty
for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified
versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of
previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside
them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in
the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.
Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If
such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those
domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to
restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program
non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal
effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or
assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

0. Definitions.

1. Source Code.The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

2. Basic Permissions.All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program,
and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly
affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from
running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use
or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any
applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty
adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention
of such measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any
medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and
any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact
all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this
License along with the Program.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the
Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you
also meet all of these conditions:

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5,
provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the
terms of this License, in one of these ways:

7. Additional Terms.“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License
by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that
are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional
permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under
those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without
regard to the additional permissions.

8. Termination.You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this
License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses
granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the
Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of
using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to
propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from
the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this
License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
License.

11. Patents.A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License
of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is
called the contributor's “contributor version”.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions
of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that
obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be
to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine
any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of
this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the
special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning
interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General
Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the
present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT
WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE
THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT
HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE,
BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best
way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each
source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an
interactive mode:

<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show
c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the
General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI
interface, you would use an “about box”.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a
“copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and
how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If
         your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
         applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public
         License instead of this License. But first, please read
