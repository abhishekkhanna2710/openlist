  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of

  this license document, but changing it is not allowed.This GCC Runtime Library
  Exception ("Exception") is an

  additional permission under section 7 of the GNU

  General Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3"). It

  applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that

  bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the

  file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along

  with this Exception.


  When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions

  of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the

  compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow

  compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to

  use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries

  covered by this Exception.


  The availability of this Exception does not imply any general

  presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the

  copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.
