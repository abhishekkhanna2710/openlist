    "body": "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSEVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n<https://fsf.org/>\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft\nlicense for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to\ntake away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU\nGeneral Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and\nchange all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software\nfor all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General\nPublic License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work\nreleased this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\nit in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or\nif you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\nyou received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly\nexplains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\nboth users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified\nversions be marked as changed, so that their problems will\nnot be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified\nversions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can\ndo so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting\nusers' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of\nsuch abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,\nwhich is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have\ndesigned this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,\nwe stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future\nversions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\nto avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program\ncould make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL\nassures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying,\ndistribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability\nprovided above cannot be given local legal effect according to\ntheir terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most\nclosely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in\nconnection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of\nliability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n1. Source Code.The “source code” for a work means the preferred\nform of the work for making modifications to it.\n“Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\nnotice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the\ncode; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and\ngive all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms\nof section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.You may convey a covered work in object code form\nunder the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you\nalso convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source\nunder the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n7. Additional Terms.“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program\nshall be treated as though they were included in this License, to\nthe extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional\npermissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used\nseparately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains\ngoverned by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n8. Termination.You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\nto propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically\nterminate your rights under this License (including any patent\nlicenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate\nor modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you\ndo not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n11. Patents.A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement\nor otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\nthey do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If\nyou cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously\nyour obligations under this License and any other pertinent\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.\nFor example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect\na royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the\nProgram, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into\na single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The\nterms of this License will continue to apply to the part which\nis the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU\nAffero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction\nthrough a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such\nnew versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT\nWARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\nA PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE\nOF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU\nASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR\nCONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING\nBUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\nOR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE\nPROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\nOR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be\nof the greatest possible use to the public, the best\nway to achieve this is to make it free software which\neveryone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line to give the program's name and\na brief idea of what it does.>Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\nas published by the Free Software Foundation, either version\n3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be\nuseful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied\nwarranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General\nPublic License along with this program. If not, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a\nshort notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n<program> Copyright (C) <year>\n<name of author>This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO\nWARRANTY; for details type `show w'.This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute\nit under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should\nshow the appropriate parts of the General Public License.\nOf course, your program's commands might be different;\nfor a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a\nprogrammer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer”\nfor the program, if necessary. For more information on\nthis, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating\n        your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a\n        subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit\n        linking proprietary applications with the library. If this\n        is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public\n\tLicense instead of this License. But first, please read\n\t<https://www.gnu.org//why-not-lgpl.html>.",
