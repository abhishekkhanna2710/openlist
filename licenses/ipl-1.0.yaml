  party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the

  acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with

  its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.

  The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses

  relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.

  In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly

  notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)

  allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the

  Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement

  negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any

  such claim at its own expense.
