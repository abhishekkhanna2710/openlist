    "body": "GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is\nnot allowed.\n\n[This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2\nof the ordinary GPL.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By\ncontrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software\nFoundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for\nyour libraries, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are\ndesigned to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can\nchange the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these\nthings.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to\nask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\nyou distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the\nrecipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the\nrecipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and\nrecompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nOur method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this\nlicense which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\nAlso, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that\nthere is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on,\nwe want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems\nintroduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that\ncompanies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\ntransforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which\nwas designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to\ncertain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read\nit in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.\n\nThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we\nusually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a\nlibrary, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to\nrunning a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked\nexecutable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public\nLicense treats it as such.\n\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not\neffectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded\nthat weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n\nHowever, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all\nbenefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is\nintended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your\nfreedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We\nhave not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as\nregards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster\ndevelopment of free libraries.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention\nto the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\". The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together\nwith the library.\n\nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than\nby this special one.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the\ncopyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Library General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is\naddressed as \"you\".\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each\ncopy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices\nthat refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this\nLicense along with the Library.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based\non the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section\n1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License\nto a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this\nLicense, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of\nto this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License\nhas appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other\nchange in these notices.\n\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in\nobject code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you\naccompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for\nsoftware interchange.\n\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with\nthe Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the\nLibrary\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and\ndistribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification\nof the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such\nmodifications.\n\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single\nlibrary together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute\nsuch a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the\nLibrary and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do\nthese two things:\n\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined\nwith any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the\nSections above.\n\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based\non the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same\nwork.\n\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\nLicense. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License\nwill not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else\ngrants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These\nactions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or\ndistributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of\nthis License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient\nautomatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or\nmodify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\nresponsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other\nreason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,\nagreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you\nfrom the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously\nyour obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence\nyou may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\nroyalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or\nindirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be\nto refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\n12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by\npatents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library\nunder this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In\nsuch case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this\nLicense.\n\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General\nPublic License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\nversion, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution\nconditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For\nsoftware which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software\nFoundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\ngoals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting\nthe sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE\nEXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE\nCOST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\nOR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE\nLIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY\nHAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we\nrecommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by\npermitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary\nGeneral Public License).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the\nstart of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a\n\"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest inthe library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) writtenby James Random Hacker.\n\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!"
