    "body": "GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n[This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is\nnumbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Library General Public License, applies\nto some specially designated Free Software Foundation\nsoftware, and to any other libraries whose authors\ndecide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\nOur General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have\nthe freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we\ngave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\nwith the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nOur method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\nthe library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you\nlegal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\nAlso, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this\nfree library. If the library is modified by someone else and\npassed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have\nis not the original version, so that any problems introduced by\nothers will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing\nfree software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus\nin effect transforming the program into proprietary software.\nTo prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\nbe licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility\nprograms. This license, the GNU Library General Public License,\napplies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite\ndifferent from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't\nassume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.\n\nThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is\nthat they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying\nor adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with\na library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply\nusing the library, and is analogous to running a utility program\nor application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the\nlinked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original\nlibrary, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.\n\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\nPublic License for libraries did not effectively promote software\nsharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We\nconcluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n\nHowever, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\nusers of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\nlibraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended\nto permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\npreserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\nlibraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to\nachieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved\nit as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The\nhope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution\nand modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference\nbetween a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses\nthe library\". The former contains code derived from the\nlibrary, while the latter only works together with the library.\n\nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered by the\nordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library\nwhich contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under\nthe terms of this Library General Public License (also\ncalled \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section\n1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General\nPublic License instead of this License to a given copy of the\nLibrary. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer\nto this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General\nPublic License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a\nnewer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense has appeared, then you can specify that version instead\nif you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\n\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative\nof it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under\nthe terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,\nwhich must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2\nabove on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled\nor linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".\nSuch a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the\nLibrary, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce\na work containing portions of the Library, and distribute\nthat work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms\npermit modification of the work for the customer's own use\nand reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a\ncombined library, provided that the separate distribution of the\nwork based on the Library and of the other library facilities is\notherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\non the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.\nThis must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\nthat part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\nwhere to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the\nLibrary except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights\nunder this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have\nnot signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to\nmodify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These\nactions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.\nTherefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any\nwork based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this\nLicense to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,\ndistributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on\nthe Library), the recipient automatically receives a license\nfrom the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or\nmodify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You\nmay not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\nexercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement\nor otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\nthey do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you\ncannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations\nunder this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example,\nif a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of\nthe Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\nthrough you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\n12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,\nthe original copyright holder who places the Library under this\nLicense may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\nexcluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\nin or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License\nincorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the Library General Public License from time to time. Such\nnew versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to\nthe author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by\nthe Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\ntwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\nsoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT\nWHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER\nPARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\nTHE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU\nASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\nDAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\nDAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY\n(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\nINACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\nTHE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\nOR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software\nthat everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by\npermitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively,\nunder the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the\nlibrary. It is safest to attach them to the start of each\nsource file to most effectively convey the exclusion of\nwarranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\"\nline and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\none line to give the library's name\nand an idea of what it does.Copyright (C) year name of author\n\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty\nof MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See\nthe GNU Library General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Library\nGeneral Public License along with this library; if\nnot, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51\nFranklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)\nor your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for\nthe library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest inthe library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) writtenby James Random Hacker.\n\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!",
