  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE


  Version 2, June 1991


  Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor,
  Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA


  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  [This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is

  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]


  Preamble


  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your

  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public

  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change

  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.


  This license, the Library General Public License, applies

  to some specially designated Free Software Foundation

  software, and to any other libraries whose authors

  decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.

  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have

  the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for

  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get

  it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of

  it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid

  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the

  rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for

  you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.


  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis

  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we

  gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the

  source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide

  complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them

  with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling

  it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.


  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright

  the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you

  legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.


  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain

  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this

  free library. If the library is modified by someone else and

  passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have

  is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by

  others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.


  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software

  patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing

  free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus

  in effect transforming the program into proprietary software.

  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must

  be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.


  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the

  ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility

  programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License,

  applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite

  different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't

  assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.


  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is

  that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying

  or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with

  a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply

  using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program

  or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the

  linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original

  library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.


  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General

  Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software

  sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We

  concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.


  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the

  users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the

  libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended

  to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while

  preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free

  libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to

  achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved

  it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The

  hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution

  and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference

  between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses

  the library". The former contains code derived from the

  library, while the latter only works together with the library.


  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the

  ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.


  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION


  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library

  which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or

  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under

  the terms of this Library General Public License (also

  called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".


  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete

  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you

  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate

  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the

  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;

  and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.


  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion

  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and

  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section

  1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:


  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General

  Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the

  Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer

  to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General

  Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a

  newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public

  License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead

  if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.


  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative

  of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under

  the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany

  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,

  which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2

  above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.


  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the

  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled

  or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".

  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the

  Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.


  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or

  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce

  a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute

  that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms

  permit modification of the work for the customer's own use

  and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.


  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the

  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library

  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a

  combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the

  work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is

  otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:


  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based

  on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.

  This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.


  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact

  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining

  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.


  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the

  Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt

  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute

  the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights

  under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or

  rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses

  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.


  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have

  not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to

  modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These

  actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.

  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any

  work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this

  License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,

  distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.


  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on

  the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license

  from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or

  modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You

  may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'

  exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible

  for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.


  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent

  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),

  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement

  or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,

  they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you

  cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations

  under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a

  consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example,

  if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of

  the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly

  through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this

  License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.


  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in

  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,

  the original copyright holder who places the Library under this

  License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation

  excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only

  in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License

  incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.


  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions

  of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such

  new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,

  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.


  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs

  whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to

  the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by

  the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we

  sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the

  two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free

  software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.


  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY

  FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT

  WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER

  PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,

  EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE

  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR

  PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF

  THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU

  ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.


  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING

  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR

  REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR

  DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL

  DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY

  (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED

  INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF

  THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER

  OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries


  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest

  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software

  that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by

  permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively,

  under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).


  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the

  library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each

  source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of

  warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"

  line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.


  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.


  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)

  or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for

  the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:


  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest inthe library `Frob'
  (a library for tweaking knobs) writtenby James Random Hacker.
