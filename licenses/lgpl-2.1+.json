It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library\nPublic License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By\ncontrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software\npackages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.\nYou can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the\nordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the\nexplanations below.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public\nLicenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software\n(and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it;\nthat you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed\nthat you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or\nto ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\nif you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the\nrecipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the\nrecipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and\nrecompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this\nlicense, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free\nlibrary. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will\nnot be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\n\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make\nsure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive\nlicense from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of\nthe library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This\nlicense, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite\ndifferent from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order\nto permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of\nthe two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria\nof freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the\nuser's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software\ndevelopers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason\nwe use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides\nadvantages in certain special circumstances.\n\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a\ncertain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely\nused non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of\npeople to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its\nvariant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\n\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure\nthat the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention\nto the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined\nwith the library in order to run.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under\nthe terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each\nlicensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each\ncopy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices\nthat refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this\nLicense along with the Library.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based\non the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section\n1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License\nto a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this\nLicense, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of\nto this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License\nhas appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other\nchange in these notices.\n\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in\nobject code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you\naccompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for\nsoftware interchange.\n\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with\nthe Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the\nLibrary\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and\ndistribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification\nof the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such\nmodifications.\n\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single\nlibrary together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute\nsuch a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the\nLibrary and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do\nthese two things:\n\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\nLicense. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License\nwill not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else\ngrants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These\nactions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or\ndistributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of\nthis License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient\nautomatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or\nmodify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\nresponsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other\nreason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,\nagreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you\nfrom the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously\nyour obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence\nyou may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\nroyalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or\nindirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be\nto refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\n12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by\npatents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library\nunder this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In\nsuch case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this\nLicense.\n\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public\nLicense from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution\nconditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For\nsoftware which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software\nFoundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\ngoals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting\nthe sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE\nEXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE\nCOST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\nOR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE\nLIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY\nHAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we\nrecommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by\npermitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary\nGeneral Public License).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the\nstart of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a\n\"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest inthe library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) writtenby James Random Hacker.\n\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990Ty Coon, President of ViceThat's all there is to it!",
