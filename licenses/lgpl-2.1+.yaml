  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE


  Version 2.1, February 1999


  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.51 Franklin Street,
  Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA


  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
  document, but changing it is

  not allowed.


  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the
  successor of the GNU Library

  Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]


  Preamble


  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
  and change it. By

  contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your
  freedom to share and change

  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.


  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
  designated software

  packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other
  authors who decide to use it.

  You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
  this license or the

  ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any
  particular case, based on the

  explanations below.


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.
  Our General Public

  Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute
  copies of free software

  (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can
  get it if you want it;

  that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs;
  and that you are informed

  that you can do these things.


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors
  to deny you these rights or

  to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain
  responsibilities for you

  if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.


  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
  fee, you must give the

  recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too,
  receive or can get the

  source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
  complete object files to the

  recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes
  to the library and

  recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.


  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library,
  and (2) we offer you this

  license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify
  the library.


  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
  warranty for the free

  library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the
  recipients should know

  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's
  reputation will

  not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.


  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
  program. We wish to make

  sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by
  obtaining a restrictive

  license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license
  obtained for a version of

  the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this
  license.


  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
  General Public License. This

  license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated
  libraries, and is quite

  different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for
  certain libraries in order

  to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.


  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
  library, the combination of

  the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original
  library. The ordinary

  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire
  combination fits its criteria

  of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for
  linking other code with

  the library.


  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less
  to protect the

  user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides
  other free software

  developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These
  disadvantages are the reason

  we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the
  Lesser license provides

  advantages in certain special circumstances.


  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
  widest possible use of a

  certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this,
  non-free programs must be

  allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does
  the same job as widely

  used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the
  free library to free

  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.


  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
  enables a greater number of

  people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use
  the GNU C Library in

  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating
  system, as well as its

  variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.


  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
  freedom, it does ensure

  that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and
  the wherewithal to run

  that program using a modified version of the Library.


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
  follow. Pay close attention

  to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses
  the

  library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the
  latter must be combined

  with the library in order to run.


  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION


  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
  which contains a notice

  placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be
  distributed under

  the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
  Each

  licensee is addressed as "you".


  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
  source code as you

  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
  publish on each

  copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
  all the notices

  that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute
  a copy of this

  License along with the Library.


  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,
  thus forming a work based

  on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the
  terms of Section

  1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:


  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
  instead of this License

  to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices
  that refer to this

  License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License,
  version 2, instead of

  to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU
  General Public License

  has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not
  make any other

  change in these notices.


  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
  under Section 2) in

  object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
  provided that you

  accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
  which must be

  distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
  used for

  software interchange.


  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
  designed to work with

  the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses
  the

  Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,
  and

  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.


  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work
  that uses the

  Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the
  Library, and

  distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms
  permit modification

  of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging
  such

  modifications.


  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
  side-by-side in a single

  library together with other library facilities not covered by this License,
  and distribute

  such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work
  based on the

  Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and
  provided that you do

  these two things:


  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
  except as expressly

  provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
  sublicense, link with, or

  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
  under this

  License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
  this License

  will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
  compliance.


  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
  However, nothing else

  grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative
  works. These

  actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
  modifying or

  distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your
  acceptance of

  this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
  distributing or modifying

  the Library or works based on it.


  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
  the recipient

  automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
  distribute, link with or

  modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose
  any further

  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are
  not

  responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.


  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other

  reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether
  by court order,

  agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
  do not excuse you

  from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
  simultaneously

  your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then
  as a consequence

  you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license
  would not permit

  royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies
  directly or

  indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
  License would be

  to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.


  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
  countries either by

  patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places
  the Library

  under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
  excluding those

  countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not
  thus excluded. In

  such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
  of this

  License.


  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
  the Lesser General Public

  License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the
  present version,

  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.


  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
  whose distribution

  conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for
  permission. For

  software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the
  Free Software

  Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided
  by the two

  goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software
  and of promoting

  the sharing and reuse of software generally.


  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
  THE LIBRARY, TO THE

  EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING
  THE COPYRIGHT

  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
  ANY

  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES OF

  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
  THE QUALITY AND

  PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE,
  YOU ASSUME THE

  COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.


  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
  ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,

  OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED
  ABOVE, BE

  LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES

  ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT
  LIMITED TO LOSS OF

  DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
  PARTIES OR A

  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH
  HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY

  HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries


  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
  use to the public, we

  recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change.
  You can do so by

  permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the
  terms of the ordinary

  General Public License).


  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
  safest to attach them to the

  start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of
  warranty; and each file should

  have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is
  found.


  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.


  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a

  "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter
  the names:


  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest inthe library `Frob'
  (a library for tweaking knobs) writtenby James Random Hacker.
