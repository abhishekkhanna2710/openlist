By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if\nyou want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new\nfree programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\nthese rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities\nfor you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we\ngave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright\nthe library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you\nlegal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there\nis no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified\nby someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they\nhave is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation\nwill not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\n\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence\nof any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by\nthe ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU\nLesser General Public License, applies to certain designated\nlibraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General\nPublic License. We use this license for certain libraries in\norder to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire\ncombination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public\nLicense permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\n\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License\nbecause it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the\nordinary General Public License. It also provides other free\nsoftware developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free\nprograms. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary\nGeneral Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser\nlicense provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\n\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that\nit becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs\nmust be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a\nfree library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.\nIn this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library\nto free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free\nsoftware. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free\nprograms enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating\nsystem, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\n\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of\nthe users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that\nis linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal\nto run that program using a modified version of the Library.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between\na \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".\nThe former contains code derived from the library, whereas\nthe latter must be combined with the library in order to run.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or\nother program which contains a notice placed by the copyright\nholder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also\ncalled \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section\n1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General\nPublic License instead of this License to a given copy of the\nLibrary. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer\nto this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General\nPublic License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a\nnewer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense has appeared, then you can specify that version instead\nif you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\n\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative\nof it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under\nthe terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,\nwhich must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2\nabove on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled\nor linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".\nSuch a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the\nLibrary, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce\na work containing portions of the Library, and distribute\nthat work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms\npermit modification of the work for the customer's own use\nand reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a\ncombined library, provided that the separate distribution of the\nwork based on the Library and of the other library facilities is\notherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the\nLibrary except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights\nunder this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have\nnot signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to\nmodify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These\nactions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.\nTherefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any\nwork based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this\nLicense to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,\ndistributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on\nthe Library), the recipient automatically receives a license\nfrom the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or\nmodify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You\nmay not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\nexercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement\nor otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\nthey do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you\ncannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations\nunder this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example,\nif a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of\nthe Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\nthrough you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\n12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,\nthe original copyright holder who places the Library under this\nLicense may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\nexcluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\nin or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License\nincorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to\nthe author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by\nthe Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\ntwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\nsoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT\nWHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER\nPARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\nTHE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU\nASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\nDAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\nDAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY\n(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\nINACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\nTHE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\nOR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software\nthat everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by\npermitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively,\nunder the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the\nlibrary. It is safest to attach them to the start of each\nsource file to most effectively convey the exclusion of\nwarranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\"\nline and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\none line to give the library's name\n\tandof what it does.Copyright (C)yearname of author\n\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty\nof MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nSee the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License\nalong with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,\nInc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Also\nadd information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)\nor your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for\nthe library, if necessary.
