Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSEVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright Â© 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n<https://fsf.org/>\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft\nlicense for software and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to\ntake away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU\nGeneral Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and\nchange all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software\nfor all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General\nPublic License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work\nreleased this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\nit in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or\nif you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\nyou received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly\nexplains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\nboth users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified\nversions be marked as changed, so that their problems will\nnot be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified\nversions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can\ndo so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting\nusers' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of\nsuch abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,\nwhich is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have\ndesigned this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,\nwe stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future\nversions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\nto avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program\ncould make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL\nassures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying,\ndistribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS",
