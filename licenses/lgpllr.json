    "body": "Lesser General Public License For Linguistic Resources\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most data are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast,\nthis License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free data--to make sure the\ndata are free for all their users.\n\nThis License, the Lesser General Public License for Linguistic Resources, applies to some specially\ndesignated linguistic resources -- typically lexicons and grammars.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any Linguistic Resource which contains a notice placed by the\ncopyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License for Linguistic Resources (also called \"this\nLicense\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Linguistic Resource as you receive it, in any\nmedium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\nLicense and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with\nthe Linguistic Resource.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Linguistic Resource or any portion of it, thus forming\na work based on the Linguistic Resource, and copy and distribute such modifications or work\nunder the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n3. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Linguistic Resource, but is designed\nto work with the Linguistic Resource (or an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource) by\nreading it or being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the\nLinguistic Resource\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the\nLinguistic Resource, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n4. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine a \"work that uses the Linguistic\nResource\" with the Linguistic Resource (or an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource)\nto produce a package containing portions of the Linguistic Resource, and distribute that\npackage under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the package\nfor the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Linguistic Resource except as\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link\nwith, or distribute the Linguistic Resource is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you\nunder this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\nfull compliance.\n\n6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else\ngrants you permission to modify or distribute the Linguistic Resource or its derivative works.\nThese actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying\nor distributing the Linguistic Resource (or any work based on the Linguistic Resource), you\nindicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for\ncopying, distributing or modifying the Linguistic Resource or works based on it.\n\n7. Each time you redistribute the Linguistic Resource (or any work based on the Linguistic\nResource), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,\ndistribute, link with or modify the Linguistic Resource subject to these terms and conditions.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights\ngranted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this\nLicense.\n\n8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other\nreason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,\nagreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you\nfrom the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously\nyour obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence\nyou may not distribute the Linguistic Resource at all. For example, if a patent license would\nnot permit royalty-free redistribution of the Linguistic Resource by all those who receive\ncopies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and\nthis License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Linguistic Resource.\n\n9. If the distribution and/or use of the Linguistic Resource is restricted in certain countries\neither by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the\nLinguistic Resource under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution\nlimitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public\nLicense for Linguistic Resources from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or\nconcerns.\n\n11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Linguistic Resource into other free programs whose\ndistribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for\npermission.\n\n12. BECAUSE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\nLINGUISTIC RESOURCE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED\nIN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE \"AS\nIS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE\nRISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE\nLINGUISTIC RESOURCE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\nCORRECTION.\n\n13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\nOR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE AS PERMITTED\nABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE\n(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES\nSUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE TO OPERATE WITH ANY\nOTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.",
