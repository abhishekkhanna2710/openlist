  Lesser General Public License For Linguistic Resources


  Preamble


  The licenses for most data are designed to take away your freedom to share and
  change it. By contrast,

  this License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
  data--to make sure the

  data are free for all their users.


  This License, the Lesser General Public License for Linguistic Resources,
  applies to some specially

  designated linguistic resources -- typically lexicons and grammars.


  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION


  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


  0. This License Agreement applies to any Linguistic Resource which contains a
  notice placed by the

  copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under
  the terms of

  this Lesser General Public License for Linguistic Resources (also called "this

  License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".


  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Linguistic Resource as
  you receive it, in any

  medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy
  an appropriate

  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that
  refer to this

  License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this
  License along with

  the Linguistic Resource.


  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Linguistic Resource or any
  portion of it, thus forming

  a work based on the Linguistic Resource, and copy and distribute such
  modifications or work

  under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
  conditions:


  3. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Linguistic
  Resource, but is designed

  to work with the Linguistic Resource (or an encrypted form of the Linguistic
  Resource) by

  reading it or being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses
  the

  Linguistic Resource". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of
  the

  Linguistic Resource, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.


  4. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine a "work that
  uses the Linguistic

  Resource" with the Linguistic Resource (or an encrypted form of the Linguistic
  Resource)

  to produce a package containing portions of the Linguistic Resource, and
  distribute that

  package under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
  modification of the package

  for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such
  modifications.


  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
  Linguistic Resource except as

  expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
  sublicense, link

  with, or distribute the Linguistic Resource is void, and will automatically
  terminate your

  rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
  rights, from you

  under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
  parties remain in

  full compliance.


  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
  However, nothing else

  grants you permission to modify or distribute the Linguistic Resource or its
  derivative works.

  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
  Therefore, by modifying

  or distributing the Linguistic Resource (or any work based on the Linguistic
  Resource), you

  indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and
  conditions for

  copying, distributing or modifying the Linguistic Resource or works based on
  it.


  7. Each time you redistribute the Linguistic Resource (or any work based on
  the Linguistic

  Resource), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
  licensor to copy,

  distribute, link with or modify the Linguistic Resource subject to these terms
  and conditions.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
  rights

  granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
  parties with this

  License.


  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other

  reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether
  by court order,

  agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
  do not excuse you

  from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
  simultaneously

  your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then
  as a consequence

  you may not distribute the Linguistic Resource at all. For example, if a
  patent license would

  not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Linguistic Resource by all those
  who receive

  copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy
  both it and

  this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Linguistic
  Resource.


  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Linguistic Resource is restricted in
  certain countries

  either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder
  who places the

  Linguistic Resource under this License may add an explicit geographical
  distribution

  limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
  in or among

  countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
  limitation as if

  written in the body of this License.


  10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
  the Lesser General Public

  License for Linguistic Resources from time to time. Such new versions will be
  similar in

  spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
  problems or

  concerns.


  11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Linguistic Resource into other
  free programs whose

  distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to
  ask for

  permission.


  12. BECAUSE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
  WARRANTY FOR THE

  LINGUISTIC RESOURCE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
  OTHERWISE STATED

  IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LINGUISTIC
  RESOURCE "AS

  IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
  NOT LIMITED

  TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE

  RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE IS WITH YOU.
  SHOULD THE

  LINGUISTIC RESOURCE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
  SERVICING, REPAIR OR

  CORRECTION.


  13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
  ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,

  OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE
  AS PERMITTED

  ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
  INCIDENTAL OR

  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
  LINGUISTIC RESOURCE

  (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
  OR LOSSES

  SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE TO
  OPERATE WITH ANY

  OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
  POSSIBILITY OF

  SUCH DAMAGES.
