As described below you may use this licence for any software that you wish to\ndistribute.\n\nIt may be particularly suitable if your software is TeX related (such as a LaTeX package file) but it may\nbe used for any software, even if it is unrelated to TeX.\n\nTo use this license, the files of your distribution should have an explicit copyright notice giving your\nname and the year, together with a reference to this license.\n\nA typical example would be\n\nGiven such a notice in the file, the conditions of this document would apply, with:\n\n`The Program' referring to the software `pig.sty' and `The Copyright Holder' referring to the person `M.\nY. Name'.\n\nTo see a real example, see the file legal.txt which carries the copyright notice for the base latex\ndistribution.\n\nThis license gives terms under which files of The Program may be distributed and modified. Individual\nfiles may have specific further constraints on modification, but no file should have restrictions on\ndistribution other than those specified below.\n\nThis is to ensure that a distributor wishing to distribute a complete unmodified copy of The Program need\nonly check the conditions in this file, and does not need to check every file in The Program for extra\nrestrictions. If you do need to modify the distribution terms of some files, do not refer to this\nlicense, instead distribute The Program under a different license. You may use the parts of the text\nof LPPL as a model for your own license, but your license should not directly refer to the LPPL or\notherwise give the impression that The Program is distributed under the LPPL.\n\nThe LaTeX Project Public License================================Terms And Conditions For Copying, Distribution And Modification===============================================================\n\nWARRANTY========\n\nThere is no warranty for The Program, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Except when otherwise\nstated in writing, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is' without warranty of any kind,\neither expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability\nand fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program\nis with you. Should The Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing,\nrepair or correction.\n\nIn no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any\nof the individual authors named in the source for The Program, be liable to you for damages, including\nany general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out\nof inability to use The Program (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered\ninaccurate or losses sustained by you or by third parties as a result of a failure of The Program to\noperate with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the\npossibility of such damages.\n\nDISTRIBUTION============\n\nRedistribution of unchanged files is allowed provided that all files that make up the distribution of The\nProgram are distributed. In particular this means that The Program has to be distributed including its\ndocumentation if documentation was part of the original distribution.\n\nThe distribution of The Program will contain a prominent file listing all the files covered by this\nlicense.\n\nIf you receive only some of these files from someone, complain!\n\nThe distribution of changed versions of certain files included in the The Program, and the reuse of code\nfrom The Program, are allowed under the following restrictions:\n\nThe above restrictions are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the updating, by any\nmethod, of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version of that file in The Program.\n\n========================================================================\n\nNOTES=====\n\nWe believe that these requirements give you the freedom you to make modifications that conform with\nwhatever technical specifications you wish, whilst maintaining the availability, integrity and\nreliability of The Program. If you do not see how to achieve your goal whilst adhering to these\nrequirements then read the document cfgguide.tex in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\n\nBecause of the portability and exchangeability aspects of systems like LaTeX, The LaTeX3 Project\ndeprecates the distribution of non-standard versions of components of LaTeX or of generally available\ncontributed code for them but such distributions are permitted under the above restrictions.\n\nThe document modguide.tex in the base LaTeX distribution details the reasons for the legal requirements\ndetailed above. Even if The Program is unrelated to LaTeX, the argument in modguide.tex may still\napply, and should be read before a modified version of The Program is distributed.\n\nConditions on individual files==============================\n\nThe individual files may bear additional conditions which supersede the general conditions on\ndistribution and modification contained in this file. If there are any such files, the distribution of\nThe Program will contain a prominent file that lists all the exceptional files.\n\nTypical examples of files with more restrictive modification conditions would be files that contain the\ntext of copyright notices.\n\nCopyright\n\n% This program can redistributed and/or modified under the termsof the LaTeX Project Public License Distributed from CTANarchives in directory macros/latex/base/lppl.txt; eitherversion 1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n* It is allowed only if the legal notice in the file does not expressly forbid it. See note\nbelow, under \"Conditions on individual files\".\n\n* You rename the file before you make any changes to it, unless the file explicitly says that\nrenaming is not required. Any such changed files must be distributed under a license that\nforbids distribution of those files, and any files derived from them, under the names used\nby the original files in the distribution of The Program.\n\n* You change any `identification string' in The Program to clearly indicate that the file is\nnot part of the standard system.\n\n* If The Program includes an `error report address' so that errors may be reported to The\nCopyright Holder, or other specified addresses, this address must be changed in any\nmodified versions of The Program, so that reports for files not maintained by the original\nprogram maintainers are directed to the maintainers of the changed files.\n\n* You acknowledge the source and authorship of the original version in the modified file.\n\n* You also distribute the unmodified version of the file or alternatively provide sufficient\ninformation so that the user of your modified file can be reasonably expected to be able\nto obtain an original, unmodified copy of The Program. For example, you may specify a URL\nto a site that you expect will freely provide the user with a copy of The Program (either\nthe version on which your modification is based, or perhaps a later version).\n\n* If The Program is intended to be used with, or is based on, LaTeX, then files with the\nfollowing file extensions which have special meaning in LaTeX Software, have special\nmodification rules under the license:\n\n* The conditions on individual files differ only in the extent of *modification* that is allowed.\n\n* The conditions on *distribution* are the same for all the files. Thus a (re)distributor of a\ncomplete, unchanged copy of The Program need meet only the conditions in this file; it is not\nnecessary to check the header of every file in the distribution to check that a distribution\nmeets these requirements.","type":""}
