  This Motosoto Open Source License (the "License") applies to "Community Portal
  Server" and related software products as well as any updatesor maintenance
  releases of that software ("Motosoto Products") that are distributed by
  Motosoto.Com B.V. ("Licensor"). Any Motosoto Product licensed pursuant to this
  License is a "Licensed Product." Licensed Product, in its entirety, is
  protected by Dutch copyright law. This License identifies the terms under
  which you may use, copy, distribute or modify Licensed Product and has been
  submitted to the Open Software Initiative (OSI) for approval.


  Preamble This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature
  and scope of this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this
  license. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of
  the License and not this Preamble. This License complies with the Open Source
  Definition and has been approved by Open Source Initiative. Software
  distributed under this License may be marked as "OSI Certified Open Source
  Software." This License provides that: You may use this License to distribute
  your own Derivative Works, in which case the provisions of this License will
  apply to your Derivative Works just as they do to the original Licensed
  Product. Alternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any
  other OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of your
  choice. If you use any license other than this License, however, you must
  continue to fulfill the requirements of this License (including the provisions
  relating to publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative
  Works that consist of the Licensed Product, including the files containing
  Modifications. New versions of this License may be published from time to
  time. You may choose to continue to use the license terms in this version of
  the License or those from the new version. However, only the Licensor has the
  right to change the License terms as they apply to the Licensed Product. This
  License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are
  defined when they are first used, and the definitions are repeated for your
  convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License. License Terms


  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
  NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR
  ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES,
  BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES
  FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY
  AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
  INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
  SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
  PARTY
