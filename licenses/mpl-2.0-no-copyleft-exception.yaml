  8. Litigation


  Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
  jurisdiction

  where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such
  litigation

  shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its

  conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's

  ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

  This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
  hereof. If any

  provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be

  reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or
  regulation

  which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
  drafter

  shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
