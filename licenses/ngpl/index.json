Stephenson)\n\n(Based on the BISON general public license, copyright 1988 Richard M. Stallman)\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license, but changing it is not\nallowed. You can also use this wording to make the terms for other programs.\n\nThe license agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy of those companies. By contrast,\nour general public license is intended to give everyone the right to share NetHack. To make sure that\nyou get the rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you\nthese rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. Hence this license agreement.\n\nSpecifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away copies of NetHack, that you\nreceive source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change NetHack or use pieces of it\nin new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to deprive anyone else of these rights.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of NetHack, you must give the recipients all the rights that you\nhave. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them\ntheir rights.\n\nAlso, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out that there is no warranty for\nNetHack. If NetHack is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that\nwhat they have is not what we distributed.\n\nTherefore we (Mike Stephenson and other holders of NetHack copyrights) make the following terms which say\nwhat you must do to be allowed to distribute or change NetHack.\n\nCOPYING POLICIES\n\nStated plainly: You are permitted to modify NetHack, or otherwise use parts of NetHack, provided\nthat you comply with the conditions specified above; in particular, your modified NetHack or\nprogram containing parts of NetHack must remain freely available as provided in this License\nAgreement. In other words, go ahead and share NetHack, but don't try to stop anyone else\nfrom sharing it farther.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of NetHack source code as you receive it, in any medium,\nprovided that you keep intact the notices on all files that refer to copyrights, to this License\nAgreement, and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the NetHack program a\ncopy of this License Agreement along with the program.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of NetHack or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such\nmodifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above (including distributing this License Agreement),\nprovided that you also do the following:\n\n3. You may copy and distribute NetHack (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in\nobject code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that\nyou also do one of the following:\n\n4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack except as expressly provided under this\nLicense Agreement. Any attempt otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack is void\nand your rights to use the program under this License agreement shall be automatically terminated.\nHowever, parties who have received computer software programs from you with this License Agreement\nwill not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.","type":"open-source"}
