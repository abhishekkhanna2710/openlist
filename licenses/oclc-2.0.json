All Rights Reserved\n\nPLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY. BY DOWNLOADING OR USING THE CODE BASE AND/OR DOCUMENTATION ACCOMPANYING\nTHIS LICENSE (THE \"License\"), YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE.\n\nSection 1. Your Rights\n\nSubject to these terms and conditions of this License, the OCLC Office of Research (the \"Original\nContributor\") and each subsequent contributor (collectively with the Original Contributor, the\n\"Contributors\") hereby grant you a non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, transferable license to execute,\nprepare derivative works of, and distribute (internally and externally), for commercial and noncommercial\npurposes, the original code contributed by Original Contributor and all Modifications (collectively called\nthe \"Program\").\n\nSection 2. Definitions\n\nA \"Modification\" to the Program is any addition to or deletion from the contents of any file of the Program\nand any new file that contains any part of the Program. If you make a Modification and distribute the\nProgram externally you are a \"Contributor.\" The distribution of the Program must be under the terms of\nthis license including those in Section 3 below.\n\nA \"Combined Work\" results from combining and integrating all or parts of the Program with other code. A\nCombined Work may be thought of as having multiple parents or being result of multiple lines of code\ndevelopment.\n\nSection 3. Distribution Licensing Terms\n\nSection 5. Termination of Rights\n\nThis non-exclusive license (with respect to the grant from a particular Contributor) automatically terminates\nfor any entity that initiates legal action for intellectual property infringement (with respect to the\nProgram) against such Contributor as of the initiation of such action.\n\nIf you fail to comply with this License, your rights (but not your obligations) under this License shall\nterminate automatically unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the\nnoncompliance. All sublicenses granted by you which preexist such termination and are properly granted\nshall survive such termination.\n\nSection 6. Other Terms\n\nExcept for the copyright notices required above, you may not use any trademark of any of the Contributors\nwithout the prior written consent of the relevant Contributor. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure\nany copyright or other proprietary rights notice contained in the Program.\n\nAll transfers of the Program or any part thereof shall be made in compliance with U.S. import/export\nregulations or other restrictions of the U.S. Department of Commerce, as well as other similar trade or\ncommerce restrictions which might apply.\n\nAny patent obtained by any party covering the Program or any part thereof must include a provision providing\nfor the free, perpetual and unrestricted commercial and noncommercial use by any third party.\n\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or settlement relating to intellectual property infringement or any\nother cause of action, conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of this License, such\nconditions do not excuse you from compliance with this License. If you cannot distribute the Program so as\nto simultaneously satisfy your obligations under this License and such other conditions, you may not\ndistribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\nredistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, you\ncould not satisfy both the patent license and this License, and you would be required to refrain entirely\nfrom distribution of the Program.\n\nIf you learn of a third party claim or other restriction relating to a Program you have already distributed\nyou shall promptly redo your Program to address the issue and take all reasonable steps to inform those\nwho may have received the Program at issue. An example of an appropriate reasonable step to inform would\nbe posting an announcement on an appropriate web bulletin board.\n\nThe provisions of this License are deemed to be severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of any\nprovision shall not affect or impair the remaining provisions which shall continue in full force and\neffect. In substitution for any provision held unlawful, there shall be substituted a provision of similar\nimport reflecting the original intent of the parties hereto to the extent permissible under law.\n\nThe Original Contributor from time to time may change this License, and the amended license will apply to all\ncopies of the Program downloaded after the new license is posted. This License grants only the rights\nexpressly stated herein and provides you with no implied rights or licenses to the intellectual property\nof any Contributor.\n\nThis License is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties concerning the\nsubject matter hereof and may not be amended except by the written agreement of the parties. This License\nshall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio and the United States\nof America, without regard to principles of conflicts of law.\n\nA. General RequirementsExcept as necessary to recognize third-party rights or third-party restriction (see below), a\ndistribution of the Program in any of the forms listed below must not put any further\nrestrictions on the recipient’s exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\nB.
