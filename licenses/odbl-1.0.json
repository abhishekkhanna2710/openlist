For example,\nif used on a Database of images (the Contents), this License would not apply to copyright over\nindividual images, which could have their own separate licenses, or one single license\ncovering all of the rights over the images.\n\n3 Rights granted\n\n3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor grants to You a worldwide,\nroyalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but only under Section 9) license to Use the Database\nfor the duration of any applicable copyright and Database Rights.
