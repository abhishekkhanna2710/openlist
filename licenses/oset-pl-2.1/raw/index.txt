You can obtain one at: www.OSETFoundation.org/public-license.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the Notice in a

as defined by the OSET Public License, v.2.1.

ANYONE WHO USES, REPRODUCES, DISTRIBUTES,

3. Responsibilities

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or RegulationIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of
the terms of this License with respect to some
or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
judicial order, or regulation, then You must:
(a) comply with the terms of this License to
the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe
the limitations and the code they affect. Such
description must be included in the notices
required under Section 3.4. Except to the
extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
such description must be sufficiently detailed
for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able
to understand it.

5. Termination

6. Disclaimer of WarrantyCovered Software is provided under this License on
an "as is" basis, without warranty of any
kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
including, without limitation, warranties that
the Covered Software is free of defects,
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
non-infringing. The entire risk as to the
quality and performance of the Covered
Software is with You.  Should any Covered
Software prove defective in any respect, You
(not any Contributor) assume the cost of any
necessary servicing, repair, or correction.
This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License.
No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License
except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of LiabilityUnder no circumstances and under no legal theory,
whether tort (including negligence), contract,
or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone
who distributes Covered Software as permitted
above, be liable to You for any direct,
indirect, special, incidental, or
consequential damages of any character
including, without limitation, damages for
lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
computer failure or malfunction, or any and
all other commercial damages or losses, even
if such party shall have been informed of the
possibility of such damages. This limitation
of liability shall not apply to liability for
death or personal injury resulting from such
party's negligence to the extent applicable
law prohibits such limitation. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental or consequential
damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
not apply to You.

8. LitigationAny litigation relating to this License may be
brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction
where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be
governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a
party's ability to bring cross-claims or
counter-claims.

9. Government Terms

10. MiscellaneousThis License represents the complete agreement
concerning the subject matter hereof. If any
provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be
reformed only to the extent necessary to make
it enforceable. Any law or regulation, which
provides that the language of a contract shall
be construed against the drafter, shall not be
used to construe this License against a
Contributor.
