  Reciprocal Public License 1.5 (RPL1.5)


  Version 1.5, July 15, 2007


  Copyright (C) 2001-2007 Technical Pursuit Inc., All Rights Reserved.


  PREAMBLE


  The Reciprocal Public License (RPL) is based on the concept of reciprocity or,
  if you prefer, fairness.


  In short, this license grew out of a desire to close loopholes in previous
  open source licenses,

  loopholes that allowed parties to acquire open source software and derive
  financial benefit from it

  without having to release their improvements or derivatives to the community
  which enabled them. This

  occurred any time an entity did not release their application to a "third
  party".


  While there is a certain freedom in this model of licensing, it struck the
  authors of the RPL as being

  unfair to the open source community at large and to the original authors of
  the works in particular.

  After all, bug fixes, extensions, and meaningful and valuable derivatives were
  not consistently

  finding their way back into the community where they could fuel further, and
  faster, growth and

  expansion of the overall open source software base.


  While you should clearly read and understand the entire license, the essence
  of the RPL is found in two

  definitions: "Deploy" and "Required Components".


  Regarding deployment, under the RPL your changes, bug fixes, extensions, etc.
  must be made available to

  the open source community at large when you Deploy in any form -- either
  internally or to an outside

  party. Once you start running the software you have to start sharing the
  software.


  Further, under the RPL all components you author including schemas, scripts,
  source code, etc. --

  regardless of whether they're compiled into a single binary or used as two
  halves of client/server

  application -- must be shared. You have to share the whole pie, not an
  isolated slice of it.


  In addition to these goals, the RPL was authored to meet the requirements of
  the Open Source Definition

  as maintained by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).


  The specific terms and conditions of the license are defined in the remainder
  of this document.
