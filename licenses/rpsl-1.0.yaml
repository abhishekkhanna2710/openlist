  RealNetworks Public Source License Version 1.0


  (Rev. Date October 28, 2002)


  1. General Definitions. This License applies to any program or other work
  which RealNetworks, Inc.,

  or any other entity that elects to use this license, ("Licensor") makes
  publicly available and

  which contains a notice placed by Licensor identifying such program or work as
  "Original Code"

  and stating that it is subject to the terms of this RealNetworks Public Source
  License version

  1.0 (or subsequent version thereof) ("License"). You are not required to
  accept this License.

  However, nothing else grants You permission to use, copy, modify or distribute
  the software or

  its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if You do not accept
  this License.

  Therefore, by modifying, copying or distributing the software (or any work
  based on the

  software), You indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its
  terms and

  conditions. In addition, you agree to the terms of this License by clicking
  the Accept button

  or downloading the software. As used in this License:


  2. Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms and
  conditions of this

  License, Licensor hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this
  License (via

  downloading or using Covered Code or otherwise indicating your acceptance of
  this License), a

  worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive copyright license, to the extent of
  Licensor's

  copyrights cover the Original Code, to do the following:


  3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses
  granted to You under this

  License:


  4. Derivative Works. You may create a Derivative Work by combining Covered
  Code with other code not

  otherwise governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Derivative
  Work as an

  integrated product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements
  of this License

  are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof, including all
  Modifications.


  5. Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to
  grant any rights to

  trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual
  property of Licensor

  or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No right is granted to
  the trademarks of

  Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Covered
  Code. Nothing in

  this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under
  different terms

  from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to
  license.

  Modifications, Derivative Works and/or any use or combination of Covered Code
  with other

  technology provided by Licensor or third parties may require additional patent
  licenses from

  Licensor which Licensor may grant in its sole discretion. No patent license is
  granted

  separate from the Original Code or combinations of the Original Code with
  other software or

  hardware.


  6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
  warranty, support, indemnity

  or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the
  license granted

  herein ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
  However, You may do so

  only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of
  Licensor or any

  Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such
  Additional Terms are

  offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold
  Licensor and every

  Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against
  Licensor or such

  Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.


  7. Versions of the License. Licensor may publish revised and/or new versions
  of this License from

  time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once
  Original Code

  has been published under a particular version of this License, You may
  continue to use it

  under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code
  under the terms

  of any subsequent version of this License published by Licensor. No one other
  than Licensor

  has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under
  this License.


  8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part
  pre-release, untested,

  or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain errors that could
  cause failures or

  loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly
  acknowledge and

  agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole
  and entire risk.

  THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT
  OF ANY KIND AND

  LICENSOR AND LICENSOR'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "LICENSOR"
  FOR THE PURPOSES

  OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES
  AND/OR CONDITIONS,

  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
  AND/OR CONDITIONS OF

  MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
  OF ACCURACY, OF

  QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. LICENSOR AND EACH
  CONTRIBUTOR DOES

  NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT
  THE FUNCTIONS

  CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION
  OF THE COVERED

  CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE
  WILL BE

  CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY
  LICENSOR, A

  LICENSOR AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.
  You acknowledge

  that the Covered Code is not intended for use in high risk activities,
  including, but not

  limited to, the design, construction, operation or maintenance of nuclear
  facilities, aircraft

  navigation, aircraft communication systems, or air traffic control machines in
  which case the

  failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe
  physical or

  environmental damage. Licensor disclaims any express or implied warranty of
  fitness for such

  uses.


  9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT
  SHALL LICENSOR OR ANY

  CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL
  DAMAGES ARISING

  OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED
  CODE, OR ANY

  PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING
  NEGLIGENCE OR

  STRICT LIABILITY), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR OR SUCH
  CONTRIBUTOR HAS

  BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE
  FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL

  PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF
  LIABILITY OF

  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  In no event

  shall Licensor's total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be
  required by

  applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of ten dollars ($10.00).


  10. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each
  Contributor retains all

  rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such
  Contributor. Licensor

  retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any
  Modifications made

  by or on behalf of Licensor ("Licensor Modifications"), and such Licensor
  Modifications will

  not be automatically subject to this License. Licensor may, at its sole
  discretion, choose to

  license such Licensor Modifications under this License, or on different terms
  from those

  contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.


  11. Termination.


  12. Miscellaneous.

  1Note: because this license contains certain reciprocal licensing terms that
  purport to extend to

  independently developed code, You may be prohibited under the terms of this
  otherwise compatible

  license from using code licensed under its terms with Covered Code because
  Covered Code may only be

  licensed under the RealNetworks Public Source License. Any attempt to apply
  non RPSL license terms,

  including without limitation the GPL, to Covered Code is expressly forbidden.
  You are responsible for

  ensuring that Your use of Compatible Source Licensed code does not violate
  either the RPSL or the

  Compatible Source License.
