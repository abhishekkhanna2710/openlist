  PREAMBLE


  Open Hardware is a thing - a physical artifact, either electrical or
  mechanical - whose design information is available to, and usable by, the
  public in a way that allows anyone to make, modify, distribute, and use that
  thing. In this preface, design information is called "documentation" and
  things created from it are called "products."


  The TAPR Open Hardware License ("OHL") agreement provides a legal framework
  for Open Hardware projects. It may be used for any kind of product, be it a
  hammer or a computer motherboard, and is TAPR's contribution to the community;
  anyone may use the OHL for their Open Hardware project.


  Like the GNU General Public License, the OHL is designed to guarantee your
  freedom to share and to create. It forbids anyone who receives rights under
  the OHL to deny any other licensee those same rights to copy, modify, and
  distribute documentation, and to make, use and distribute products based on
  that documentation.


  Unlike the GPL, the OHL is not primarily a copyright license. While copyright
  protects documentation from unauthorized copying, modification, and
  distribution, it has little to do with your right to make, distribute, or use
  a product based on that documentation. For better or worse, patents play a
  significant role in those activities. Although it does not prohibit anyone
  from patenting inventions embodied in an Open Hardware design, and of course
  cannot prevent a third party from enforcing their patent rights, those who
  benefit from an OHL design may not bring lawsuits claiming that design
  infringes their patents or other intellectual property.


  The OHL addresses unique issues involved in the creation of tangible, physical
  things, but does not cover software, firmware, or code loaded into
  programmable devices. A copyright-oriented license such as the GPL better
  suits these creations.


  How can you use the OHL, or a design based upon it? While the terms and
  conditions below take precedence over this preamble, here is a summary:


  TERMS AND CONDITIONS


  1. Introduction


  2. Patents


  3. Modifications


  You may modify the Documentation, and those modifications will become part of
  the Documentation. They are subject to this Agreement, as are Products based
  in whole or in part on them. If you distribute the modified Documentation, or
  Products based in whole or in part upon it, you must email the modified
  Documentation in a form compliant with Section 4 to each Licensor who has
  provided an email address with the Documentation. Attempting to send the email
  completes your obligations under this Section and you need take no further
  action if any address fails.


  4. Distributing Documentation


  5. Making Products


  6. NEW LICENSE VERSIONS


  TAPR may publish updated versions of the OHL which retain the same general
  provisions as the present version, but differ in detail to address new
  problems or concerns, and carry a distinguishing version number. If the
  Documentation specifies a version number which applies to it and "any later
  version", you may choose either that version or any later version published by
  TAPR. If the Documentation does not specify a version number, you may choose
  any version ever published by TAPR. TAPR owns the copyright to the OHL, but
  grants permission to any person to copy, distribute, and use it in unmodified
  form.


  7. WARRANTY AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS
